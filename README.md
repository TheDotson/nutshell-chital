# Clown College
This was part two of a group project.  Part one had us establish full CRUD for a specific theme that was given to the team.  Part two involved us trading projects with a different team and picking up where they had left off.

The challenge here was that the full CRUD requirements for part one were at most 25% finished.  This presented the chance for our team to strategize and divide the labor up of refracting the unfinished code from the previous team's project into working code.  From there, we added the extra functionality of being able to dynamically assign teacher, leaasons, and students to different classes, and assign those classes to majors.
